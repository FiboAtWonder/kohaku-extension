/**
 * BigInt-safe `structuredClone` polyfill for the WebView worker.
 *
 * WebKit bug present in iOS < 17.4: a BigInt in the
 * payload corrupts the structured-clone object-reference pool, so a repeated
 * object reference deserializes to the wrong slot. In the portfolio state
 * (tokens carry BigInt amounts and many shared/repeated price structures) this
 * mangles `priceIn`/`marketDataIn`/`meta` into BigInt garbage — e.g. `priceIn`
 * arrives as `496n` instead of `[{ baseCurrency, price }]` — and the dashboard
 * crashes on `priceIn.find`/`.some`. iOS 17.4+, the simulator, and Hermes are
 * unaffected.
 *
 * On affected engines we replace the global with a deterministic pure-JS deep
 * clone that preserves BigInt primitives and the structured types the wallet
 * clones. The override is gated by a probe that reproduces the actual bug (see
 * isNativeStructuredCloneSafe); correct engines keep their native one. Runs in
 * the worker only (the host uses Hermes), before any controller code executes.

/**
 * Returns true when the native structuredClone is free of WebKit bug
 * (rdar://118868470), fixed in iOS/Safari 17.4.
 * https://www.mail-archive.com/webkit-changes@lists.webkit.org/msg209161.html
 *
 * Root cause of the bug: CloneDeserializer::readBigInt() wrongly pushed entries
 * into the object-reference pool (`m_gcBuffer`). Every BigInt thus shifted the
 * indices that later `ObjectReferenceTag` back-references resolve against, so a
 * repeated object reference resolved to the WRONG slot — typically pulling a
 * BigInt out where an object/array belonged. This is exactly how the portfolio's
 * `priceIn`/`marketDataIn`/`meta` came back as `496n`/`431n`/`597n`.
 *
 * The trigger therefore requires BOTH: BigInt values AND an object that appears
 * more than once (creating a back-reference). Our first probe missed the bug
 * because it had no repeated reference. This probe reproduces it faithfully: a
 * few BigInts followed by a duplicated object reference, then asserts the
 * back-reference still resolves to the same object — the bug's direct signature.
