// File/Directory API (cleaner, sync ops, no nullable documentDirectory dance).

// Materializes the WebView worker bundle from the OTA-shipped copy into a writable,
// app-sandboxed dir and returns the `file://` URI of its HTML entry, so the WebView can
// load the OTA'd worker via `file://` (preserving the strict CSP + SHA-384 SRI).
//
// Why: the worker bundle (the wallet's core controllers) used to ship ONLY as a native
// asset baked into the signed app, which an OTA cannot replace. We now also emit it into
// the Metro/OTA JS bundle (webview-bundle-ota.json), write it out here, and load from the
// writable copy - so OTA updates reach the worker. If anything fails, the caller falls back
// to the native-asset copy, so the worker always has a working bundle to boot.
//
// SECURITY: once the worker ships via OTA, its integrity depends on signed OTA delivery.
// This is guarded by Stallion bundle signing (StallionPublicSigningKey embedded in the native
// config + the bundle signed with --private-key at publish; see scripts/publish-ota.sh), which
// must be configured for verification to be enforced. The HTML's SRI only guards HTML<->JS
// consistency; a compromised OTA controls both, so it is defense-in-depth, not the primary guarantee.
