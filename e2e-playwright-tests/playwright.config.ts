     * We are starting the extension with `chromium.launchPersistentContext`,
     * not the default Playwright way, because of the extension setup.
     *
     * Because of this, whatever we pass to `video`, it simply doesn't work,
     * because our newly created context is not the default one.
     *
     * The workaround is to pass `recordVideo: { dir: 'test-results/videos' }`
     * to `chromium.launchPersistentContext`, but then all tests are being recorded,
     * not only the failed ones.
     *
     * There could be ways for fixing it, but for now the traces we have (html-report),
     * is perfectly fine for debugging, because we can simply load in in the local Playwright
     * with `npx playwright show-report` and in seconds we can see the real test failura reason.
