/**
 * Regression guard for the extension UI bundle size.
 *
 * The popup/tab UI is meant to be a thin client that talks to the background service worker and
 * renders serialized controller state. Business logic (controllers) and their heavy dependencies
 * - most notably the humanizer and its multi-megabyte address dataset, the hardware-wallet SDKs,
 * etc. must NOT be eagerly bundled into the UI.
 *
 * This test opens the dashboard as an already-set-up, unlocked user (the common case) and sums
 * the JavaScript actually downloaded on load. It intentionally does not measure get-started,
 * since that route now deliberately bundles heavier onboarding-only screens (Ledger/QR).
 *
 * If this fails, do NOT just bump the budget - first check whether background-only code leaked
 * into the UI (see the import-type eslint rule). Only raise the budget for a
 * deliberate, understood increase.
