 *   - base64 of the 32 raw bytes — how private keys are often stored/transported in binary protocols
 *   - base64url variant of the above (URL-safe alphabet, no padding)
 *   - base64 of the hex string itself (as text, not bytes)
 *   - base64url variant of the above
 *   - percent-encoded (URL encoding of the hex string)
 *
 * For a seed phrase these encodings are also computed on the full phrase string,
 * but seed leak detection primarily relies on containsConsecutiveSeedWords() instead.
 *
 * Encodings shorter than 8 chars are dropped to prevent false positives.
